<h1>Trinity</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. It was founded in 1869 and has been located in three different Texas cities: Tehuacana, Waxahachie, and now San Antonio. Trinity is an academically rigorous institution committed to inspiring growth and ambition in its students. It also has a beautiful campus, which is right next to the San Antonio Zoo and the Olmos Park. It is also close to the Quarry, the Pearl, and the downtown area. There are plenty of places to explore close to campus.</p>

<p> The features I appreciate most about Trinity are the professors and the beautiful campus. I have yet to take a class in which I don't enjoy the professor. They have all been engaging, skilled at teaching, kind, and helpful. The campus is also a great environment. It makes a difference getting to walk to class with green trees, lush grass, a blue sky, and warm red brick buildings surrounding me. </p>

<p> I chose Trinity because of the academic rigor, the caliber of professors, the friendly environment, and the financial aid. When I first decided to visit Trinity it was because it had offered me a very good aid and scholarship package. I didn't know much about the university and had been wanting to go to school in California. However, once I got here I fell in love with the trees, hills, green grass, and enjoyed the friendly people. I quickly learned about the academic excellence expected and the professors. By the end of the day I knew I wanted to come here. </p>

<p> I plan to major in Psychology and Spanish. I chose Psychology because I want to help people as a Psychologist one day and I enjoy analyzing how the human mind works. I decided to add a major in Spanish because I want to become fluent and learn more about the many cultures it represents. I also plan to minor in Philosophy because I find it very satisfying to learn how to ask good questions and think logically through complex and abstract problems. Here are some links to important information about my interests.</p>
